_To celebrate 3 years Robo Instructus is 50% off on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1032170) & [itch.io](https://bigabgames.itch.io/robo-instructus) for the next 7 days._

The game has received a few updates over the year, the latest _1.34_. Notable improvements include full game translations in Español (es) & 简体中文 (zh-CN) these were contributed by generous multilingual heroes to [the OSS translation repo](https://github.com/big-ab-games/robo-instructus-translation) just under a year ago. I also added autocomplete configuration allowing completion using the return key `↲` & improved the scroll bar usability in September.

| Sales by platform |  | In the last year |
|---|---|---|
| Steam | 3984 | 618 |
| itch.io | 39 | 5 |

The vast majority of sales continue to be on Steam. Down from 822 last year which is to be expected as the game ages.

| Last year Steam sales by region |
|---|---|
| United States | 28% |
| Russian Federation | 19% |
| Germany | 7% |
| Brazil | 4% |
| United Kingdom | 4% |
| China | 3% |
| Canada | 3% |

| Last year Steam sales by OS |
|---|---|
| Windows* | 86.2% |
| Linux | 7.9% |
| Mac | 5.9% |

_* Steam doesn't actually count Windows explicitly, so this tally is the sales that are **not** counted as Linux or Mac._

## Feedback
On Steam the game is currently rated **Very Positive** with **80% of 50** user reviews, nice to see the "very" qualifier there now! I guess having at least 50 reviews is a requisite.

### Achievements

Looking at a couple of choice Steam achievements, **The Gist** which you get for completing the 4th level _(ie you've actually had a go at the game)_ is 65%, up again from 63.6 last year. **Open The Vault** which you get for completing the game is at 0.7%, down from 0.8. So I guess a few more people have played the game this year, but struggle to complete the whole thing.

_You can play the Robo Instructus demo and buy the game on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1032170) & [itch.io](https://bigabgames.itch.io/robo-instructus)._
