Robo Instructus was released 5 years ago today, time flies! Let's take a look at the last 12 months.

<!--more-->

In the last year there have been just a couple of updates [1.35](https://github.com/big-ab-games/robo-instructus/releases/tag/1.35) in December & [1.35.1](https://github.com/big-ab-games/robo-instructus/releases/tag/1.35.1) today. The game is fairly old now and I don't expect to make any big changes to it other than continuing to maintain the game & ensure it runs well.

This is probably the last year I'll do this post publishing sales info, I think the first 5 years are probably more than enough to satisfy anyone's curiosity.

| Sales by platform |  | In the last year |
|---|---|---|
| Steam | 4882 | 439 |
| itch.io | 45 | 1 |

The vast majority of sales continue to be on Steam. Pretty similar to last year. 9% of sales coming in the 5th year actually seems a pretty good tail.

| Last year Steam sales by region |
|---|---|
| United States | 33% |
| Russian Federation | 9% |
| Germany | 6% |
| Brazil | 4% |
| Canada | 4% |
| Netherlands | 4% |
| France | 3% |
| United Kingdom | 3% |
| Australia | 3% |
| Japan | 2% |
| Other | 29% |

| Last year Steam sales by OS |
|---|---|
| Windows* | 86.0% |
| Linux | 9.4% |
| Mac | 4.6% |

_* Steam doesn't actually count Windows explicitly, so this tally is the sales that are **not** counted as Linux or Mac._

## Feedback
On Steam the game is currently rated **Very Positive** with **84% of 58** user reviews. It's always lovely to a see new positive user review appear.

## Demo
The game has always had a demo available since release, so why not also look at the demo install stats from Steam.

| Steam demo installs | In the last year |
|---|---|
| 22980 | 5853 |

**So after 5 years I can say Robo Instructus didn't really make much money, but I'm proud of what I made.**
**To everyone that played my little game about programming: Cheers!**

_You can play the Robo Instructus demo and buy the game on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1032170) & [itch.io](https://bigabgames.itch.io/robo-instructus)._
