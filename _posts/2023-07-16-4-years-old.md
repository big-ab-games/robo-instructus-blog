Robo Instructus came out 4 years ago today. Let's take a look at the last 12 months.

<!--more-->

In the last year there have been just a couple of updates released [1.34.1](https://github.com/big-ab-games/robo-instructus/releases/tag/1.34.1) & [1.34.2](https://github.com/big-ab-games/robo-instructus/releases/tag/1.34.2). They each included fixes and optimisations.

To highlight a particular optimisation I added runtime detected AVX2/SSE4.2 optimisations to text rendering glyph rasterization ([alexheretic/ab-glyph#66](https://github.com/alexheretic/ab-glyph/pull/66)). They make one part of the complex text rendering process significantly faster for ~99% of players. For those interested in SIMD optimisation in rust I wrote a piece on how I went about this work back in November: [Getting rustc to use AVX2 SIMD](https://alexheretic.github.io/posts/auto-avx2/).

I aim to continue to maintain the game ensuring it runs well and benefits from improvements in the wider OSS rust ecosystem.

| Last year Steam sales by OS |
|---|---|
| Windows* | 85.7% |

_* Steam doesn't actually count Windows explicitly, so this tally is the sales that are **not** counted as Linux or Mac._

## Feedback
